            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Naemah. I am someone who is naturally curious and always eager to learn. I am drawn to the world of business and finance, not just because it is interesting, but because I love piecing together how everything works and uncovering what really drives change. Coming from a background where financial stability wasn’t always certain, I am motivated to make a real impact in the industry and help create a space for people like me.</p>
        
            <p>I think of myself as an explorer at heart. I like to take my time to understand things, appreciating the details and finding meaning in each step. Beyond finance, I am inspired by fresh ideas, meaningful conversations, and the chance to discover something new every day. I am also someone who values loyalty and deep connections – those qualities really matter to me, and I cherish the chance to build relationships that last.</p>
        
            <p>Thank you for visiting my corner of the internet. I am glad you are here, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!</p>

            <h3>1. Tech Troubles and Trust: How Deloitte is Tackling Misinformation in Financial Services</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges currently facing the financial services industry, and firms such as Deloitte, is the relentless pace of technological advancement. Constant adaptation is essential, as highlighted in Deloitte's <em>The Green Room</em> podcast episode, <em>Questions That Really Matter in Business</em>.</p>
            <p>A recent study discussed in the podcast reveals that <strong>70% of people are deeply concerned about misinformation</strong>, an issue compounded by the rise of deepfakes, security risks, and data privacy breaches. These challenges risk eroding public trust and come with a high price for companies working to counteract misinformation. With the rapid growth of AI-generated content, including sophisticated deepfakes, companies are operating in an increasingly complex environment where maintaining information integrity is paramount.</p>
            
            <!-- Example of a deepfake image -->

            </figure>

            <p>As the podcast points out, society’s reliance on trust, often seen as the “glue” that holds communities together, places significant responsibility on firms like Deloitte. Addressing this challenge requires more than just technology; real solutions come from combining advanced tech with human vigilance. Fact-checking, critical thinking, and accountability are essential for ensuring that technology supports truth and reliability.</p>
            <p>For Deloitte, this means advising clients on responsible AI use, enhancing cybersecurity measures, supporting stricter data privacy regulations, and fostering a culture of digital awareness. By confronting these issues head-on, Deloitte plays a role in building a more trustworthy digital environment.</p>
